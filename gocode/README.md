# Convorse

## Getting Started

Convorse is written with [Revel](http://revel.github.io), A high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

Place this gocode directory in your `$GOPATH/src/` and rename it to convorse.

What the file structure should be like: `$GOPATH/src/convorse/app/views/...`

### Start the web server:

    revel run convorse

   Run with <tt>--help</tt> for options.

### Go to http://localhost:9000/

And you should see the convorse desktop login screen
